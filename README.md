# Building the Frontend (Event-Driven JavaScript)

## Frontend Framework and WebSocket Setup

Choose a framework: If you want to build a reactive frontend, you could use React.js, Vue.js, or stick to vanilla JavaScript for simplicity.
Implement WebSocket: Use WebSockets (with Socket.IO or native WebSocket API) to establish a persistent connection between the client and the server for real-time updates.
Handle Document Events: Create a basic collaborative document editor where users can input text, and each keystroke or change is broadcasted to all connected clients via WebSocket events.

## Real-time Document Updates

Implement a simple text area where changes in the document are captured and sent to the server.
Use WebSockets to send these updates to the server, and broadcast them to all connected users.
Ensure the document updates in real-time for all users (the front-end should listen to WebSocket messages).
